    <h1>Hi and welcome to the timetable website !</h1>

    <p>
        I know... It looks bad asf, but I don't have that much time you know !
        Well anyways, you can access to today's activities from <a href="{{ path('day') }}">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you ever need to search for a specific day... <a href="{{ path('app_search') }}">click here</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Design in progress...
    </p>
